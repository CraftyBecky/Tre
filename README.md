#Trek-Logo-Grid
This was a practice for me to learn Grid and make it responsive.

I really needed to learn CSS Grid as this was one part of CSS that I had not learned yet. So I thought why not make it fun and do it with some Star Trek logos and Communicator Badges. I also needed more work on making webpages responsive, so I worked on this. Sometimes making it way more complicated then I needed it to be by trying to add grid-columns and rows to every breakpoint. Not needed, thanks to the Grid Template Areas. It came out exactly how I had it in my head.
